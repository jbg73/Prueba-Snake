Git repo with the solution of the Snake problem

There are two versions (snake.py and snakeOOP.py) that solve the problem. The first one solves it by using 
the default way to programm, some specific functions and a main. It also uses global variables. The second version uses
the Object Oriented Paradigm, that is, all the variables and functions are inside a class (attributes and methods). It 
allows us to have a more intuitive insight of the suggested solution.

In both mains, the 3 tests are evaluated and the answer is shown via terminal. They all work good and return the expected result
